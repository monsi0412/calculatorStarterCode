# calculatorStarterCode

## This project is a calculator, it takes an input and does some sort of math operation to give an output

For example, if you input a 9 by clicking on the corresponding number, then clicked the sqrt button, the calculator 
would give you the square root of 9, an output of 3.
The functions that the calculator is able to perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the log base 10, finding the square root, raising to any power, and generating a random number.
## If I had more time...
I would make it so that the code can perform more than one operation without the user having to clear the field every time.
Another thing I would do would be to add more functions to the calculator, such as making you able to do a log with any base, or different kinds of roots (cubed, fourth, etc.)
